This is particularly useful for testing and debugging. This is not type stable

    DictWriter()

A simple in-memory writer. Useful for interactive work and debugging.

You can retrieve values using the typical dictionary interface and using as keys
the names of the stored diagnostics.

Example
========

Assuming we have a diagnostic with short output name "mydiag" stored in `dictW`.
`dictW["mydiag"]` will be a dictionary with keys the timesteps when the data was
saved. The values are the diagnostic output (typically a `ClimaCore` `Field`).

end

"""
    write_field!(writer::DictWriter, field, diagnostic, u, p, t)

Add an entry to the `writer` at time `t` for the current `diagnostic` with value
`field`.

`DictWriter` is backed by a dictionary. Most typically, the keys of this
dictionary are either strings, the `output_short_name` of the diagnostic. If the
`output_short_name` is not available, use the diagnostic itself. The values of
this dictionary is another dictionary that maps the time `t` to the `field` at
that value.

`DictWriter` implements a basic read-only dictionary interface to access the
times and values.
