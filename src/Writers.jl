"""
The `Writers` module defines generic writers for diagnostics with opinionated defaults.

Currently, it implements:
- `DummyWriter`, does nothing, useful for testing ClimaDiagnostics
- `DictWriter`, for in-memory, dictionary-based writing
- `HDF5Writer`, to save raw `ClimaCore` `Fields` to HDF5 files
- `NetCDFWriter`, to save remapped `ClimaCore` `Fields` to NetCDF files

Writers can implement:
- `interpolate_field!`
- `write_field`
- `Base.close`
- `sync`
