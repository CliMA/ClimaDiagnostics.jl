v0.2.5
-------

## Features

### Add support for box spaces with LatLong points in `NetCDFWriter`.

The `NetCDFWriter` can now work with regional boxes with `LatLong` points. Due
to incompatibility in `ClimaCore`, only `LatLong` points are supported (and not
`LongLat` points). This means that the box has to be created with latitude on
the x axis and longitude on the y axis.
